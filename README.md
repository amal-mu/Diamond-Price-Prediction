Knowing what makes a diamond either expensive or cheap is important for people who are interested in purchasing diamonds or are diamond-enthusiasts.
In order to fully understand how the pricing system of diamonds worked, it was imperative to collect data on the features taken into account for pricing diamonds as well as their prices. Then, the dataset was further analyzed to build graphs highlighting important qualities of a diamond. Finally, a predictive model was created to predict the prices of diamonds.
